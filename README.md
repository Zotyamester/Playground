# Playground

It contains all sorts of stupid (or are they?) little experiments I've done in C/C++(/in the future
I might add my adventurous toy programs written in Rust and x86 assembly).

The goal here is not to write professional, top of the line, battle-tested, robust programs, but to have a
collection of handy, little methods & neat tricks that can make life easier.

Notice how inconsistent this repo is at the moment.
Some files are related to performance optimization tricks, while others are focused on expressing common
algorithms in the most idiomatic, most "C/C++"-ish way.
